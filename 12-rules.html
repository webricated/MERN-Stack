    <div class="rule">
        <h2>RULE ONE: Trick Your Brain with the 20 minute Rule</h2>
        <p>Learning to code is a bit like going to the gym. Even if you max out and spend a whole weekend at the gym, you will not see a visible difference in your body. The more regularly you learn to code, the more likely it is that you'll start seeing your ripped coding muscles. 💪</p>
        
        <p>But the problem is where do you find the time? Between working your full-time job, spending time with your family and life admin, when are you supposed to sit down and practice this "daily coding"?</p>
        
        <!-- Continue with the rest of Rule One content -->
    </div>

    <!-- Repeat for Rules 2-12 following the same pattern -->

    <div class="rule">
        <h2>RULE TWO: Code for a Purpose</h2>
        <p>When I first started learning how to code, there were countless times when I picked it up then gave up, again and again. This is a common story amongst self-taught coders...</p>
        <!-- Continue with Rule Two content -->
    </div>

    <!-- Continue with remaining rules -->

    <!-- Previous rules above -->

    <div class="rule">
        <h2>RULE THREE: There is No "Perfect" Language to Learn</h2>
        <p>Whenever I do large talks, there will always be one person who asks me "which programming language should I start learning first"?</p>
        <p>There is this common perception that somewhere out there lies a perfect language for beginner programmers. Some argue it's Python, some say it's Javascript.</p>
        <p>But I say they're all wrong.</p>
        <p>A programming language is simply a tool. It is no different from any other tool in your hardware box. If you want to hammer a nail, you should be using a hammer. If you want to fix your water pipes, you'll probably need a spanner.</p>
        <!-- Additional content for Rule Three -->
    </div>

    <div class="rule">
        <h2>RULE FOUR: Understand What You're Writing</h2>
        <p>I have an issue with the way that most programming tutorials are written.</p>
        <p>There are far too many tutorials where you see the "this is how you draw an owl" phenomenon.</p>
        <p>It's almost as if the programmer had good intentions and started by showing you how to do everything step-by-step. But then, at some point, he realises that he has embarked on a Sisyphean task and gives up.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="rule">
        <h2>RULE FIVE: It's Ok to Not Know</h2>
        <p>Software engineers are purportedly the profession that has the largest population of Imposter Syndrome sufferers</p>
        <p>Imposter Syndrome is a psychological phenomenon where people feel like frauds and massively underestimate their own skills and abilities.</p>

        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="rule">
        <h2>RULE SIX: Be a Copycat</h2>
        <p>At the beginning of my coding journey, I thought the way to learn to code was to read a whole bunch of books. I bought books on C++, C#, Java and loads more. You name it, I had it. But they didn't do very much other than make me confused.</p>

            <span class="quote-author">- Pablo Picasso</span>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="rule">
        <h2>RULE SEVEN: Be Accountable</h2>
        <p>Be accountable to someone. Show your work.</p>
        <p>The biggest problem with online coding courses is the lack of accountability. No doubt there are loads of great Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), such as Coursera, Udacity, Udemy, Skillshare. But what are the consequences of not doing your homework or missing a month's worth of lectures? Nothing. Nobody cares.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="rule">
        <h2>RULE EIGHT: Keep Learning</h2>
        <p>Being a good programmer is a bit like being Madonna.</p>
        <p>Don't run out and buy your cone-shaped bras just yet. What I mean is programming will keep evolving. In order to stay relevant, you have to keep reinventing yourself.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="rule">
        <h2>RULE NINE: Play Foosball</h2>
        <p>When you see Hollywood movies about programmers, they're usually sat in front of a laptop, mashing the keyboard like they're in some sort of high-stakes "smash the mole" game.</p>
        <p>When you see real programmers working. They tend to look like this: Yep, that's right. No typing. Just staring. A lot of staring.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="rule">
        <h2>RULE TEN: Get a Mentor</h2>
        <p>When I was learning French, I came across a method that resulted in the greatest leap in my speaking abilities. That was having language exchanges over Skype.</p>
        <p>While we were having a conversation in French, he would correct my pronunciation or grammar and suggest ways that I could construct my sentences to sound more native.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="rule">
        <h2>RULE ELEVEN: Get into the Habit of Chunking</h2>
        <p>So you have an awesome idea. But it's way-way-way too complicated for your current skill level. What do you do? You join the Chunking Express.</p>
        <p>Nope, I'm not talking about the art-house movie. I'm talking about breaking down your programming problem.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="rule">
        <h2>RULE TWELVE: Break someone else's code</h2>
        <p>One of the most important steps to take in order to make the jump from learner coder to a fully-fledged programmer is understanding how to get help. Everyone needs help. Everyone, including those so-called "God Level Programmers".</p>
